Theatrical Players Refactoring Kata
====================================

The first chapter of ['Refactoring' by Martin Fowler, 2nd Edition](https://www.thoughtworks.com/books/refactoring2) 
contains a worked example of this exercise, in javascript. That chapter is available to download for free. 
This repo contains the starting point for this exercise in Java, with tests.

What you need to change
-----------------------
Refactoring is usually driven by a need to make changes. In the book, Fowler adds code to print the statement as HTML 
in addition to the existing plain text version. He also mentions that the theatrical players want to add new kinds of 
plays to their repertoire, for example history and pastoral.

Automated tests
---------------
In his book Fowler mentions that the first step in refactoring is always the same - to ensure you have a solid set of 
tests for that section of code. However, Fowler did not include the test code for this example in his book. 
[Approval testing](https://approvaltests.com) approach has been used to add some tests. It is a powerful technique for 
rapidly getting existing code under test and to support refactoring.
